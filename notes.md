of all moves that a bot can make...

# grouped goal instructions
- winner used this
- for attacking or defending we want our ants to consolidate
- for food we want our ants to spread out
## get food
- assign some bots the task of seeking and getting food
- or maybe have ants that happen to be close get food
## attack
- stage ants while numbers increase before going to attack
- attack as large mass to not lose numbers
## defend
- create blockades around our hills
    - potentially have \# of ants protecting each hill as time goes on
    - either as one large mass around hill or expand a ring outward near entry points
- create barriers between large masses of enemy ants and strategic points
    - strategic points may be regions with a lot of food access or navigationally significant points

# theories
- create blocks to make it so that enemy ants have to go through our ants to get to our hills
- choke points will probably be important
- blocking choke points will require less ants than protecting open space
- the larger of a ring we have, the more safe and easily accesible food we will have
